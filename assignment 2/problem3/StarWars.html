            A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> is a fictional energy sword featured
            throughout the <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> franchise. A
            typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">
            lightsaber</a> is depicted as a luminescent
            plasma blade about 3 feet (0.91 m) in length emitted from a metal
            hilt around 10.5 inches (27 cm) in length.[1] First introduced in
            the original <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> film,[a] it has
            since appeared in most <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> films,
            with at least one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>
            duel occurring in each installment of the "Skywalker saga". The
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>'s distinct appearance was created using
            rotoscoping for the original films, and with digital effects for the
            prequel and sequel trilogies.

            As presented in the films, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>'s energy
            blade can cut, burn, and melt through most substances with little
            resistance.[4] It leaves cauterized wounds in flesh, but can be
            deflected by another blade, by energy shields,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> or by the metal beskar. The blade has
            even been used as a tool to weld metal. Other times, the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> has been shown to cause bleeding wounds
            in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic
            saber-proof melee weapons have been introduced in the Expanded
            Universe as well as later episodic films. An active
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> gives off a distinctive hum, which rises
            in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air.
            Bringing the blade into contact with another
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>'s blade produces a loud crackle.

            For the original <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> film, the film
            prop hilts were constructed by John Stears from old Graflex press
            camera flash battery packs and other pieces of hardware. The
            full-sized sword props were designed to appear ignited onscreen, by
            later creating an "in-camera" glowing effect in post-production. The
            blade is a three-sided rod which was coated with a Scotchlite
            retroreflector array, the same sort used for highway signs.[14] A
            lamp was positioned to the side of the taking camera and reflected
            towards the subject through 45-degree angled glass so that the sword
            would appear to glow from the camera's point of view.

            Set decorator Roger Christian found the handles for the Graflex
            Flash Gun in a photography shop in Great Marlborough Street, in
            London's West End.[15] He then added cabinet T-track to the handles,
            securely attaching them with cyanoacrylate glue. Adding a few
            "greebles" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the
            first prototype of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> prop for Luke before
            production began. George Lucas decided he wanted to add a clip to
            the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt.
            <span class="blue-p">
              When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s
              audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New
              Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age
              of movies... They marched backward through the
              looking-glass.</span
            >
            Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to John
            Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so
            that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in
            post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's
            prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia,
            where filming on Star Wars began.[16] It was discovered, however,
            that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's
            orientation to the camera, and during the Obi-Wan Kenobi/Darth Vader
            duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow
            would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also
            allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.

            Korean animator Nelson Shin, who was working for DePatieâ€“Freleng
            Enterprises at the time, was asked by his manager if he could
            animate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> in the live-action scenes of
            a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live-action footage
            was given to him. He drew the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>s with a
            rotoscope, an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of
            the physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> blade prop. Shin explained
            to the people from Lucasfilm that since a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> is made of light, the sword should look
            "a little shaky" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one
            frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film
            on an optical printer, making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also
            recommended adding a degausser sound on top of the other sounds for
            the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field.
            The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm
            showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to
            use an X-Acto knife to give the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> a very
            sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>s were present in the earliest drafts as
            mundane plasma weapons that were used alongside laser guns.[21][22]
            The introduction of the Force in a later revision made the Jedi and
            the Sith supernaturally skilled; initially they were only portrayed
            as swordsmen.[23] The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> became the
            Force-user's tool, described in A New Hope by Obi-Wan Kenobi as "not
            as clumsy or random as a blaster. An elegant weapon, for a more
            civilized age."[24] The source of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>'s
            power is a kyber crystal.[25] These crystals are also the power
            source of the Death Star's superlaser.

            Since the release of the first film, replicas of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>s have been a popular piece of Star Wars
            merchandise, ranging from inexpensive plastic toys to the "Force FX"
            series from Master Replicas, deluxe replicas which use LED-lighted
            tubes and sound effects to create a close audio-visual
            representation of what is seen on screen.Disneyland in California
            sells <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>-themed churros outside its Star
            Tours attraction.[45] Disneyland and Disney World (Hollywood
            Studios) also sell legacy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>s which are
            replicas of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> seen used by the Jedi and
            Sith in the movies such as Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rey
            Skywalker, Count Dooku, and Kylo Ren.[46][47] Disneyland and
            Hollywood Studios also offer Savi's Workshop, a place where guests
            can build their own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> and choose their own
            kyber crystal, thereby changing the blade color of their own unique
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>.[48][49][50] Besides Savi's Workshop,
            there is another custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> experience. The
            Star Trader at Disneyland offers guests a chance to build their own

            With the advent of motion-controlled video games, players were given
            the opportunity to wield an in-game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> with
            their own hands. In the seventh generation of video game consoles,
            there were several <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> video games
            available on the Wii (Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga,
            <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b>: The Force Unleashed, Star Wars:
            The Clone Wars â€“ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> Duels,

            Heroes and Lego <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> III: The Clone
            Wars) and one on the Xbox 360 (Kinect
            <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b>) that utilized motion controls to
            wield a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> through arm gestures. Unleashed
            and Duels, both developed by Krome Studios, have more precise
            control of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>, allowing players to swing
            it in any of five different directions (up, down, left, right or
            forward) with the Wii Remote, while Kinect takes advantage of the
            eponymous, camera-based motion controller to grant the player a more
            fluid, one-to-one control method of swinging the
