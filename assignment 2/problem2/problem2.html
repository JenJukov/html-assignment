          Finding Nemo is the best-selling DVD title of all time, with over 40 million copies sold as of 2006,
           and was the highest-grossing G-rated film of all time before Pixar's own Toy Story 3 overtook it. 
           The film was re-released in 3D in 2012. In 2008, the American film Institute named it as the 10th greatest
           American animated film as part of their 10 Top 10 lists. A sequel, Finding Dory, was released in June 2016.ome
           time later, Marlin is overprotective of Nemo, born with a stunted right fin. On Nemo's first day of school, Marlin embarrasses Nemo
           , and the two argue. While Marlin is talking to Nemo's teacher, Nemo defiantly approaches a nearby speedboat, where a pair of scuba divers
            capture him. Marlin pursues the boat in vain and meets Dory, a blue tang with acute short-term memory loss, who offers her help. The two encounter
             Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating fish. Marlin discovers a diver's mask that fell from the boat; he accidentally hits Dory with it, 
             giving her a nosebleed. The scent sends Bruce into a feeding frenzy, but they flee after accidentally setting off a ring of old naval mines, which knock Marlin and Dory unconscious.
              Nemo is placed in an aquarium in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney, Australia. He meets the "Tank Gang", including yellow tang Bubbles, starfish Peach, cleaner shrimp 
              Jacques, blowfish Bloat, royal gramma Gurgle, and twin damselfish Deb and Flo, led by Gill, a Moorish idol. Nemo learns he is to be given to Sherman's young niece, Darla, who has k
              illed her previous fish. Gill devises a risky escape plan: Nemo, who can fit inside the aquarium's filter tube, will jam the filter with a pebble, forcing Sherman to put the fish into 
              plastic bags while he cleans the tank, allowing them to roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts the maneuver, but fails and is almost killed. Marlin and Dory wake up
               unharmed, but the mask falls into a deep trench. They descend after it and encounter an anglerfish that chases them. Dory memorizes the address written on the goggles, and they escape.
                Dory and Marlin receive directions from a school of moonfish, but Marlin disregards them to take what he believes is a safer route. They stumble into a forest of jellyfish, the stings
                 of which knock them unconscious. They awaken in the East Australian Current with a group of sea turtles, including Crush and his son, Squirt. Marlin tells them about his quest, and 
                 the story is relayed across the ocean to Sydney, where a pelican, Nigel, tells the Tank Gang. Inspired by his father's bravery, Nemo makes another attempt to jam the filter and 
                 succeeds, and soon the aquarium is covered in green algae.

        The inspiration for Finding Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that 
        the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the
         time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in
          the park but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.
