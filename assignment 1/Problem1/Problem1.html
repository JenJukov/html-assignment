         <p> <front style="color: red;">John Connor</front>, the son of <front style="color: rgb(173, 47, 157);">Sarah Connor</front> and Kyle Reese, is the leader of the worldwide human Resistance, as well as the more specialised Tech-Com during the War Against the Machines.<br>
            Skynet, the supercomputer mainframe of the machines,decides that <front style="color: red;">John Connor</front> is the focal point of the rebellion and his termination would end the opposition.<br>
            After repeated failures at terminating <front style="color: red;">John </front> during the war, Skynet decides to use a time displacement device to send Terminators to various points in the past in an attempt to terminate him before the war even begins.

         <h3 style="color:rgb(32, 13, 196);font-size: 40px;"><u>Original Timeline</u><h3>
        
         <p>  On the brink of extinction, <front style="color: red;">John Connor</front> united the despairing humans and taught them to fight, storm the camps and overcome the Terminator guards.<br> 
             Much of the Resistance was created from these survivors.
             <front style="color: red;">John Connor</front> led the human Resistance to the victory in the War against the Machines in the year <u> 2029 </u>.<br>
             In order to eliminate <front style="color: red;">John Connor</front>, Skynet sent a <front style="color: rgb(8, 173, 71);">T-800</front> and a <front style="color: rgb(8, 173, 71);">T-1000</front> to the past to 
             kill <front style="color: red;">John's</front> mother, <front style="color: rgb(173, 47, 157);">Sarah </front>, and young <front style="color: red;">John Connor</front>
              respectively via Time Displacement Equipment.<br>
             Thus, <front style="color: red;">John </front> sends Kyle Reese, a young soldier, and a reprogrammed Series 800 Terminator to the past to protect <front style="color: rgb(173, 47, 157);">Sarah </front> Connor and young <front style="color: red;">John Connor</front> respectively.

                <p> <front style="color: red;">John Connor</front> was born to <front style="color: rgb(173, 47, 157);">Sarah Connor</front> on <u>February 28, 1985</u>.
                 His father, Kyle Reese, had been killed nine months prior in <u>May 1984</u>, protecting <front style="color: rgb(173, 47, 157);">Sarah </front> from a time-traveling Terminator.<br>
                 <front style="color: red;">John's</front> early life was filled with training by various persons his mother <front style="color: rgb(173, 47, 157);">Sarah </front> had met as the two lived off the grid after the attempt on her life by the Terminator.<br>
                 Much of his training concentrated on the areas of weaponry, computer technology, and espionage.
                 When <front style="color: rgb(173, 47, 157);">Sarah </front> Connor was shot and captured after trying to blow up a computer factory in the early <u>1990s</u>,<br> <front style="color: red;">John </front> was placed into foster care and told that his mother's stories of the future were merely delusions.<br>
                 He was unable to cope with life in suburbia and rebelled, edging towards delinquency,<br> turning into a young gangster and receiving a police record (which included trespassing, shoplifting, disturbing the peace, and vandalism) by the time he was<u>10 years old</u>.<br> 
                 His foster parents, Todd and Janelle Voight, found themselves unable to deal with him, and were not surprised when a police officer showed up at their door asking to speak with <front style="color: red;">John </front>.
