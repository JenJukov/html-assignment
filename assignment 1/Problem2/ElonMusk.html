        </p>

        <h2>Early life</h2>

        <h3>Childhood and family</h3>

        <p>Elon Reeve <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> was born on <ins>June 28, 1971</ins>, in Pretoria, one of the capital cities of apartheid South Africa.[8][9] <br>
            His mother is Maye <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> (nÃ©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in <br>
            South Africa.[10][11][12] His father is Errol <span class = "Musk">Musk</span>, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, <br>
            consultant, and property developer who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[13]<br>
            [14] <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[12][15] His <br>
            maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on <br>
            record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa and Australia.[16][17][18] <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> has <br>
            British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[19][20] He was baptized into the Anglican Church.
        </p>

        <p><span class = "Musk">Musk</span>'s family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a <br>
            representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with the <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> children reportedly sharing their father's <br>
            dislike of apartheid.[8] After his parents divorced in <ins>1980</ins>, <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> mostly lived with his father,[19] a choice he <br>
            made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[23] <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> has become estranged from his father.<br>
            [23] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Education</h3>

        <p>Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[31] <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> applied for a Canadian passport <br>
            through his Canadian-born mother.[32][33] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of <br>
            Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.[34] <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> <br>
            arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[35] working odd jobs <br>
            at a farm and lumber-mill.[36] In <ins>1990</ins>, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[37][38] Two years <br>
            later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in <br>
            physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School in <ins>1995</ins>.
        </p>

        <p>In 1994, <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle <br>
            Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based <br>
            startup Rocket Science Games.[41] In <ins>1995</ins>, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in <br>
            materials science at Stanford University in California.[42] <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> tried to get a job at Netscape but never received <br>
            a response to his inquiries.[32] He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet <br>
            boom and launch a startup.
        </p>

        <h2>Business career</h2>

        <h3>Zip2</h3>

        <p>In <ins>1995</ins>, <span class = "Musk">Musk</span>, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds borrowed <br>
            from <span class = "Musk">Musk</span>'s father.[44][23] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[45] The company <br>
            developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and <br>
            yellow pages.[46] <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and <br>
            instead rented an office; he slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.
        
        </p>

        <p>According to <span class = "Musk">Musk</span>, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the <br>
        time."[45] The <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[48] and <br>
        persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[49] <span class = "Musk">Musk</span>'s attempts to become <br>
        <span class = "ceo">ceo</span> were thwarted by the board.[50] Compaq acquired Zip2 for <span class = "doll">$</span>307 million in cash in February <ins>1999</ins>,[51][52] <br>
        and <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> received <span class = "doll">$</span>22 million for his 7-percent share.
        </p>

        <h3>X.com and PayPal</h3>

        <p>In <ins>1999</ins>, <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[54] The startup was <br>
            one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers <br>
            joined the service.[55] The company's investors regarded <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit <br>
            <span class = "ceo">ceo</span> Bill Harris by the end of the year.[56] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid <br>
            competition.[45][56][57] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel,[58] Confinity had its own money-transfer <br>
            service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.
        </p>

        <p>Within the merged company, <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> returned as <span class = "ceo">ceo</span>. <span class = "Musk">Musk</span>'s preference for Microsoft software over Unix created <br>
            a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[60] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive <br>
            business model, the board ousted <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> and replaced him with Thiel in September <ins>2000</ins>.[61][b] Under Thiel, the <br>
            company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[63][64] In <ins>2002</ins>, PayPal was acquired <br>
            by eBay for <span class = "doll">$</span>1.5 billion in stock, of which <span class = "Musk">Musk</span>-the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares-received <span class = "doll">$</span>175.8 <br>
            million.[65][66] In <ins>2017</ins>, <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it <br>
            has sentimental value.         
        </p>

        <h3>SpaceX</h3>

        <p>In early <ins>2001</ins>, <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a <br>
            growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[69] In October the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and <br>
            Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads <br>
            into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> was seen as a novice[70] and <br>
            the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February <ins>2002</ins>, the group returned to Russia with Mike <br>
            Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered <br>
            one rocket for <span class = "doll">$</span>8 million, which <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable <br>
            rockets.[70] With <span class = "doll">$</span>100 million of his early fortune,[71] <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> founded <span class = "SpaceX">SpaceX</span> in <ins>May 2002</ins> and became the <br>
            company's <span class = "ceo">ceo</span> and Chief Engineer.
        </p>

        <p><span class = "SpaceX">SpaceX</span> attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in <ins>2006</ins>.[74] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth <br>
            orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator <br>
            (and former <span class = "SpaceX">SpaceX</span> consultant[75]) Mike Griffin later that year.[76][77] After two more failed attempts that <br>
            nearly caused <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> and his companies to bankrupt,[74] <span class = "SpaceX">SpaceX</span> succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in <br>
            <ins>2008</ins>.[78] Later that year, <span class = "SpaceX">SpaceX</span> received a <span class = "doll">$</span>1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract from <br>
            NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the <br>
            Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[79] In <ins>2012</ins>, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private <br>
            enterprise.[80] <span class = "Musk">Musk</span> credited the NASA award, one of the last actions by Mike Griffin as NASA Administrator, for <br>
            saving the company.
