            Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and
            non-representational art, are closely related terms. They are
            similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning. Abstraction indicates
            a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. This
            departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or
            complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims
            for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be Abstract,
            at least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible.
            Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form
            in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially Abstract.
            Total Abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything
            recognizable. In geometric Abstraction, for instance, one is
            unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art
            and total Abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative
            and representational (or realistic) art often contain partial
            Abstraction.

            Much of the art of earlier cultures signs and marks on pottery,
            textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock used simple,
            geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or
            decorative purpose. It is at this level of visual meaning that
            Abstract art communicates. One can enjoy the beauty of Chinese
            calligraphy or Islamic calligraphy without being able to read it.

            Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the
            public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists.
            Three art movements which contributed to the development of Abstract
            art were Romanticism, Impressionism and Expressionism. Artistic
            independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An
            objective interest in what is seen, can be discerned from the
            paintings of John Constable, J M W Turner, Camille Corot and from
            them to the Impressionists who continued the plein air painting of
            the Barbizon school. Early intimations of a new art had been made by
            James McNeill Whistler who, in his painting Nocturne in Black and
            Gold: The falling Rocket, (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual
            sensation than the depiction of objects. Even earlier than that,
            with her 'spirit' drawings, Georgiana Houghton's choice to work with
            Abstract shapes correlate with the unnatural nature of her subject,
            in a time when Abstraction isn't yet a concept .

            In Chinese painting, Abstraction can be traced to the Tang dynasty
            painter Wang Mo , who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink
            painting style. While none of his paintings remain, this style is
            clearly seen in some Song Dynasty Paintings. The Chan buddhist
            painter Liang Kai applied the style to figure painting in his
            "Immortal in splashed ink" in which accurate representation is
            sacrificed to enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of
            the enlightened.A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to Tiantai
            buddhism, created a series of splashed ink landscapes that
            eventually inspired many Japanese Zen painters. His paintings show
            heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are
            barely visible and extremely simplified. This type of painting was
            continued by Sesshu Toyo in his later years.
