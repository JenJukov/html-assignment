            <span> <h1>22 Essential Apps I Use Daily — 2022</h1> </span>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>I have never shared my suite of essential apps before, so here it is. As I have multiple devices running different 
                    operating systems(Android, iOS, macOS, Windows), I give a first priority to apps with cross-platform support.</p>
            </div>

            <h2><span style="color: #1970F7">Note taking</span></h2>

            <div class="text-content">
     <p>
        <span style="color: #06C755"><u>Google Keep:</u></span> For quick notes, shopping lists for the day, and
        short notes I want to keep handy. It employs Material You design
        which looks nice on my Pixel 5. My notes are synchronised and
        accessible on all my devices.
        <p><span style="color: #06C755"><u>Notability:</u></span> For written notes,
        scribbles, language learning, meeting notes. My notes are backed
        up to Google Drive.The only downside is that the app is
        available only on iOS and macOS.</p>
        <p> <span style="color: #06C755"><u>Notion:</u></span> For serious notes,
        travel plans, wikis, learning, notes that need text formatting.
        Notion is very powerful at being a database and creating
        interactive notes. I can also collaborate with friends when
        planning a trip.</p>
        <p> <span style="color: #06C755"><u>Standard Notes:</u></span> For plain text notes. I like
        the simplicity and the sense of privacy and security that
        Standard Notes offers. Notes are encrypted end-to-end and you
        can also lock the app with different passcodes on each device.
        More features can be added (on paid plans) through extensions.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #06C755"><u>TickTick:</u></span> For to-do lists. I can organise tasks into lists,
        assign a priority, repeat occurrences, add tags, add subtasks,
        and do habit checks. The app is simple, lightweight, and works
        fast on all my devices.</p>

   <p> <span style="color: #06C755"><u>Edison Mail:</u></span> An email client on my iPad. I just like the design.

    <p><span style="color: #06C755"><u>Gmail:</u></span> It comes with my phone and it works well so I don’t want to download anything else and keep two email apps on my phone.</p>
           
                        
    <p><span style="color: #06C755"><u>LINE:</u></span> For messaging family and high school friends. I don’t really want to use it because the app is big and 
        bloated, but it has been well embodied in Thai culture since many businesses and government services offer Slack: My company uses this. 
        their communication and membership channels there.</p>
                        
        <p><span style="color: #06C755"><u> Telegram:</u></span> For messaging friends. I can tell you this is the BEST messaging app. It is lightweight and crazy fast 
       on all my devices. It has creative and useful features I and my friends actually use and love. The app is simple 
       and interactions feel natural.</p>

  <div class="text-content">
   <p><span style="color: #06C755"><u>DuckDuckGo Browser:</u></span> I don’t want to be tracked. The good things are random private emails and tracking 
      prevention. The downside as of this writing is that the desktop version doesn’t support extensions so I have to 
        manually open 1Password, search for credentials and click autofill. Having no extensions means I have to 
        organise my bookmarks manually too (with Raindrop).

        <P><span style="color: #06C755"><u>Raindrop.io:</u></span> For saving links. I can organise my links with tags and folders.</p>

                 <p> <span style="color: #06C755"><u>1Password:</u></span> For storing and generating credentials. The user interface is clean and feels welcoming. It can store 
                    OTP’s and automatically fill them (but I don’t use that feature). It can check if your passwords have appeared in 
                    breaches, or are reused on multiple services. It can store many kinds of credentials other than passwords: SSH 
                    keys, notes, identities, etc. Browser extensions work quite fast too.</p>
                    
                    <p><span style="color: #06C755"><u>Aegis:</u></span> For storing OTP’s. It is simple, fast and lightweight. I can backup the vault—encrypted—so I don’t have 
                    to reconfigure 2FA on all services when I change my phone. I wanted to use 1Password for storing OTP’s 
                    because it would automatically fill them, but what’s the purpose of two-factor authentication, then?</p>
