          Gene is an exuberant emojiðŸ˜ƒ who was born without a filter.
          Because of this, he is able to take the appearance of multiple
          different standard emojiðŸ˜€s. In the beginning of the movie, he is
          shown to be unable to control this, yet later in the movie he has
          control over his quirk. He is shown right-handed when he tries to
          write on Spam, the white envelope who thinks about sales to trick
          others.

          Smiler is the main antagonist in the emojiðŸ™‚ Movie. She is the
          system supervisor of the company and was voiced by Maya Rudolph. She
          thinks she is the "original emojiðŸ™‚" even though she could have
          just decorated the floor like that. She later got braces when she
          broke out her tooth when Poop arrested her when he tried to save
          Textopolis and stop her from deleting Gene.

          Talk about a cast of characters! Our team built over 300 unique
          emojiðŸ˜€, troll, pirate, and virus characters.
          <br />
          The typical time to rig a unique character is extensive, but our
          rigging supervisor worked with our development team to devise
          'smart' rigging systems. Our AutoRig tool was developed for The
          emojiðŸ˜€ Movie to create quick procedural rigs on diverse secondary
          characters, based on factors in the model that the code can analyze.
          Characters like Pizza, Donut, Bathtub, Christmas Tree, and many
          others were rigged in a fraction of the time it typically takes.
